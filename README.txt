POINT ROTATION TESTING:

Point to rotate:
	POINT3(V3(20.0f, 50.0f, 50.0f), V3(255, 0, 0))
Axis:
	LINE3(V3(-100.0f, 0.0f, 200.0f), V3(100.0f, 100.0f, -100.0f), V3(0, 0, 255))

Click New Button to see point rotate by 2 degrees about axis.

Click DBG to rotate 3D coords (you can also adjust the starting perspective).

When running, you will be able to see the graph plotted in as the dot rotates around the axis.
