POINT ROTATION TESTING:

VARIABLES (already set in code): 

	Rotating Point:
		POINT3(V3(20.0f, 50.0f, 50.0f), V3(255, 0, 0))
	Axis:
		LINE3(V3(-100.0f, 0.0f, 200.0f), V3(100.0f, 100.0f, -100.0f), V3(0, 0, 255))

BUTTONS:

	Click New Button to see point rotate by 2 degrees about axis.
	Click DBG to rotate 3D coords (you can also adjust the starting perspective).

INSTRUCTIONS:
	
	1. Run. Point and axis should appear.
	2. Click "New Button" until 360 degrees are completed. XYZ graphs wil automatically be generated and graphed.
	3. Have fun! Play around with the perspective, add polygons, try breaking it, etc.
